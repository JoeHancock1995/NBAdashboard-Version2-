# NBAdashboard-Version2-
My own version of the NBA dashboard. NBA dashboard is an app that displays all the NBA teams with recent scores, players, and the weather in that city for the following week. The idea being that as a user their should be a place to see the latest information and details about NBA basketball teams and players with a simple and straightforward layout.
