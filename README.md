## Overview
Welcome to Project 1! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

## Key Topics
* Server-side APIs
* Git branching workflow
* Agile software development

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What is agile software development?
2. What is an MVP?
3. If you pull down a teammate's branch and you have merge conflicts, how do you handle it?

## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project
* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project
* Resolve merge conflicts
* Explain agile software development
* Design, build and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages
* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project
